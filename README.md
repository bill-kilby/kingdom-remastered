# Kingdom: Remastered
Please note: This is not currently finished! There is still a lot to complete.

**To see the most recent version, please check [my website](https://billkilby.dev/projects/kingdom_remastered/kingdom). This repository is only updated with major changes.**

A pure Javascript project that is inspired by a script I made when I was 14. It currently generates landmasses, topography, fauna, and rivers. Human features are planned for the future. 

## Project Overview

Created in early January 2024, this project generates a world map depending on the variables chosen by the user. Intended to be a supportive tool for mapmakers 

This README will be updated once the project has been completed. I estimate I will have it done by mid-February to early-March.


Below are some examples of the current generation.

This project is currently **not** open source - this will be updated once the project is done, as I'd like people to build on my work once it's in a better state.
